# EDIST2

This repository presents "EDIST2: Error Distance Approach for Drift Detection and Monitoring" proposed by Imen Khamassi et al.[(Self-Adaptive Windowing Approach for Handling Complex Concept Drift)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12559-015-9341-0). 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* JDK 7+
* MOA 2016+

### Features
* EDIST2 was proposed in order to deal with these complex drifts EDIST2 monitors the learner performance through a self-adaptive window that is autonomously adjusted through a statistical hypothesis test. This statistical test provides theoretical guarantees, regarding the false alarm rate, which were experimentally confirmed.
